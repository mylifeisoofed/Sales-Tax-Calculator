## Sales Tax Calculator APP

This is a simple state sales tax calculator app I made in Android Studio written in Kotlin utilizing Jetpack Compose.

Simply enter the price tag and the app will calculate the tax and total after applying sales tax.
It currently only applies Washington state sales tax ( will add other states soon ^_^ )

TODO:
- Implement a selection option for users to select states that have sales taxes.
- Maybe look for an API to hook up to grab up-to-date data for each state's sales tax.
